# Office Hours

We will be holding both in-person and virtual office hours this semester. All in-person TA and UCA office hours are held in **TBD**. Faculty members will hold their office hours in their own offices.

Please do come to office hours for:

- Help with material or homework
- Exam review
- Logistical questions
- Reviewing past exams, quizzes, or homework
- Anything else you might need assistance with!

The Spring 2026 office hour schedule will be posted here closer to the beginning of the semester.

# Office Hours

We will be holding both in-person and virtual office hours this semester. All in-person TA and UCA office hours are held in **TBD** (the tower). Prof. Minea's office hour are held in his office (LGRC A261). Virtual office hours are on zoom, see the table below for the link.

Please do come to office hours for:

-   Help with material or homework
-   Exam review
-   Logistical questions
-   Reviewing past exams, quizzes, or homework
-   Anything else you might need assistance with!

The Spring 2025 office hour schedule will be posted here closer to the beginning of the semester.

Welcome to the eleventh discussion! This week we'll review program correctness.

## Materials

Download the lab slides [here](https://github.com/umass-compsci-220/public-materials/raw/main/discussion/Lab%2011%20-%20No%20Solutions.pdf).

After lab we'll publish the solutions [here](https://github.com/umass-compsci-220/public-materials/raw/main/discussion/Lab%2011%20-%20Solutions.pdf).

Today there is no starter code, you'll submit a picture of your work to gradescope instead.
